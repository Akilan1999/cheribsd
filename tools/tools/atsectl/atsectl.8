.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility reads and configures the MAC address of Altera Triple-Speed
Ethernet
.Pq Xr atse 4
network interfaces.
The MAC address for all ATSE interfaces is derived from a value stored in
.Xr cfi 4
flash at a board specific offset.
The interpertation of the stored MAC address is documented in
.Xr atse 4 .
.Pp
The current address may be read by supplying the
.Fl l
flag.
.Pp
A specific address may be written using the
.Fl s
option.
Alternatively a random address derived from the factory PPR of the DE4's
Intel StrataFlash chip
.Pq as retrieved from the cfi0.factory_ppr kernel environment variable
can be generated and written with the
.Fl u
flag.
By default the address will have the locally administered bit set.
This can be unset by adding the
.Fl g
flag to the command line.
.Pp
Finally, a summary of usage information can be printed by supplying the
.Fl h
flag.
.Sh BUGS
The
.Nm
interface should be command oriented rather than requiring an unobvious
selection of flags.
