.Sh NAME
.Nm qtrace
.Nd start and stop instruction tracing in a QEMU host VM
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
exec
.Ar command
.Op Ar ...
.Nm
start
.Nm
stop
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility starts and stops logging of instruction traces in a QEMU host
virtual machine.
.Pp
The
.Dq start
and
.Dq stop
commands start and stop logging when run.
The
.Dq exec
command forks a child, starts logging, calls
.Xr execve 2
to run the
.Ar command
and its arguments and stops logging when the child exits.
.Pp
Due to the volume of output in an instruction trace, file I/O may be
backlogged for tens of second (or more) after tracing ends so make
sure it has stopped before examining the output.
.Sh IMPLEMENTATION NOTES
Logging is triggered through special nop instructions and is a virtual
machine property so the results of running
.Nm
in multiple login are apt of be confusing.
